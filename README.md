</br>

Passionate about frontend development and UX/UI. I have started learning coding in 2019. It was when I had began noticing <b>how automation speeds up my work and improves efficiency</b>. I created a brand of house designs for sale from scratch. I was trying to play the role of my potential clients and I realized how important it is to <b>present information in a simple and intuitive way.</b> This is how my career path has began turning into frontend development.
As I am an <b>architect</b> - I know 3D modeling, design tools and have aesthetic sense. <b>Civil engineering</b> taught me how to solve problems and think analytically. I love psychology and self-development. I am a traveler who has seen many faces of humanity and can be empathetic, which helps in UX designing.
